# Integration Guide: Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Profile Ingestion and Access

## Overview

Partners should use this integration guide to assist them in building out ingress and egress functionality with the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP). There are APIs for batch ingestion, streaming ingestion, and Unified Profile access (egress). 

To assist in development, a [Postman collection](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/exchange-aep-profile-integration-postman) has been created by the Adobe Exchange team. This Postman collection will be referenced throughout the integration guide.

More details on installing and using the Postman collection are available on the Github [README](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/exchange-aep-profile-integration-postman/blob/master/README.md) page. There are also sample datasets of [loyalty](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/exchange-aep-profile-integration-postman/blob/master/AEP%20loyalty%20events.json) and [profile](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/exchange-aep-profile-integration-postman/blob/master/AEP%20loyalty%20profiles.json) data.
